# CTRACR

## Objective

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many drastic changes in our lives. From trying to set up an online based workflow, to finding interesting things to do, times have been tough for all of us. As we start to transition to the new normal, a tool that will allow us to track COVID-19 cases would be invaluable. CTRACR is an app targeted at group organizers who hope to manage safe in-person events. It allows users to check into/out of events, see detailed information about each event, and report a positive COVID-19 test result. Once this is done, the system automatically notifies all participants who may have come into contact with the sick individual. They will be advised to get tested and will be referred to the cdc website (cdc.org) for more information. Every small step toward a safer future will be key to fighting back against the common enemy.
